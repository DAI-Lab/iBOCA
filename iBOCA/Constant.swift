    static let ORIENTATION = "The Orientation test will ask you to answer to the best of your ability, the current date, day of the week, state you are in, and time. Enter this information using the scroll wheels provided, if you do not know the answer to a question, tap on the \"Don't Know\" button located next to or below the question. When you are done answering, tap on the \"Complete\" button."
    static let SIMPLE_MEMORY = "The Simple Memory test consists of an observation stage and a recall stage. In the observation stage you will be presented with a series of items which you should name out loud as you go through them. Remember the names of the items as you will be asked to repeat them during the recall stage. After the observation stage you will wait one minute before starting the recall stage. In the recall stage you will type the names of the items into the text fields provided. To do this simply tap on a text field and a keyboard will automatically pop up, use the keyboard to type the name of the item. When you are done typing, tap the enter button on the keyboard to move onto the next text field. Order does not matter on the test, only correctly recalling the series of items."
    static let VISUAL_ASSOCIATION = "The Visual Association test is broken up into 3 stages: display, recall and recognize. The display stage will show a series of images with 2 distinct objects in each image, as you go through each image state the names of the objects out loud while also remembering the objects for later. The recall stage will show the same images as the display stage but with one of the objects missing, type the name of the missing object in the denoted area. The recognize stage will show 2 similar images with one of them being an image shown in the display stage, tap on the image that was shown in the display section."
    static let TRAILS = "The Trails B test consists of a map of numbered bubbles. This test requires you to connect these bubbles together in number-letter-number-letter ascending order. For example 1 goes to A, A goes to 2, 2 goes to B, and so on. If the bubbles are incorrectly connected, the line will turn blue and you will have to start at the last correctly connected bubble. The test is complete upon connecting all the bubbles."
    static let FORWARD_DIGIT_SPAN = "The Forward Digit Span consists of 2 stages, the listening stage, and the recall stage. During the listening stage the iPad will read out a series of numbers, which you will remember. Then during the recall stage, you will be prompted to enter the series of numbers into the keypad on the right of the screen in the exact same order as you heard them. Once you are done entering tap the \"Enter\" key on the keypad and get ready for the next listening stage and series of numbers. You will have a second attempt at every level if you miss the first and the test will be over upon 2 misses in a row on the same level. This test does involve sound so make sure the iPad's volume is up loud enough for you to clearly hear the numbers."
    static let BACKWARD_DIGIT_SPAN = "The Backward Digit Span consists of 2 stages, the listening stage, and the recall stage. During the listening stage the iPad will read out a series of numbers, which you will remember. Then during the recall stage, you will be prompted to enter the series of numbers into the keypad on the right of the screen in the reverse order of how you heard them. For example 123 would be entered as 321. Once you are done entering tap the \"Enter\" key on the keypad and get ready for the next listening stage and series of numbers. You will have a second attempt at every level if you miss the first and the test will be over upon 2 misses in a row on the same level. This test does involve sound so make sure the iPad's volume is up loud enough for you to clearly hear the numbers."
    static let THREE_DIMENSION_FIGURE_COPY = "The 3D figure Copy test will present an image or shape on the left side of the screen, your task is to copy that image to the best of your ability on the right side of the screen, use your finger as a pen to draw. If you make a mistake tap on the \"eraser\" button and use your finger to erase anything, then tap the \"pen\" button to go back to drawing. When you are done copying the image tap the \"Done\" button to move to the next image."
    static let SERIAL_SEVENS = "The Serial 7's test will give you a starting number displayed on your left. You will then repeatedly subtract 7 from that number and enter in the results on the keypad on the right of the screen. When you are done entering the result on the keypad make sure to tap the \"Enter\" button. The test will always stop before you reach negative numbers. For example if the starting number is 30 you would enter 23, then 16, then 9 and finally 2."
    static let NAMING_PICTURE = "The Naming Pictures test will display an image of an item on the screen, your task is to type the name of the item into the text field provided. To do this simply tap on the text field and a keyboard will automatically pop up, use the keyboard to type the name of the item. When you are done typing, tap the enter button on the keyboard to move onto the next image."
    static let FORWARD_SPATIAL_SPAN = "The Forward Spatial Span test is made up of a series of squares which will light up in a pattern. Once the pattern is finished lighting up, you will be prompted to recall the pattern and tap on the squares that lit up in the exact same order as the pattern was displayed. You will have a second attempt at every level if you miss the first and the test will be over upon 2 misses in a row on the same level."
    static let BACKWARD_SPATIAL_SPAN = "The Backward Spatial Span test is made up of a series of squares which will light up in a pattern. Once the pattern is finished lighting up, you will be prompted to recall the pattern and tap on the squares that lit up in the backwards order as the pattern was displayed. This means that you will start with the end of the displayed pattern and finish with the beginning. You will have a second attempt at every level if you miss the first and the test will be over upon 2 misses in a row on the same level."
